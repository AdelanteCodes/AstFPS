## Purpose and applicability

A lightweight client-side utilities mod for Minecraft on Fabric.

This catalogue description is publisher-stated. It does not establish an FPS gain or unchanged behavior.

Client support: `required`. Server support: `unsupported`.

## Mechanism review still needed

The interface and symbol map below identify where the implementation attaches. They are extracted evidence, not a substitute for reading the control flow. Do not treat this entry as a completed understanding.

- Trace initialization and each hot-path hook to the helper methods it calls.
- Establish cache keys, ownership, invalidation, reload, world-change, and shutdown behavior where applicable.
- Distinguish saved work from removed visual/gameplay behavior, scheduling changes, or configuration presets.
- Check exceptions, fallback, thread handoffs, and interactions with other hooks.
- Compare complete output/state with the original behavior before using an idea in Xe-Mod.

## Verification boundary

Static research only. No runtime behavior, visual equivalence, compatibility guarantee, or FPS increase is established by this note. Publisher claims and implementation observations are kept separate.
